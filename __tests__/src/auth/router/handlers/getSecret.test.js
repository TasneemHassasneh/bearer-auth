/* This code is a unit test for the `handleSecret` function, which is a route handler for a users route in an authentication module. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the `handleSecret` function responds with the expected behavior.

Here's an overview of the code:

1. **Setting up environment and dependencies**: The code starts by setting up the environment with the `use strict` directive and setting the `SECRET` environment variable. It then requires the `handleSecret` function from the appropriate path.

2. **Route Handler Test**: The test is wrapped inside a describe block titled "testing the users route handler."

   - **Test**: The test, titled "Should respond with a secret response," sets up the necessary request, response, and next function objects. It calls the `handleSecret` function with these objects. The expectation is that the response will have a status code of 200 (OK) and that the `res.send` function will be called with any argument.

The test uses Jest's assertions and the `.toHaveBeenCalledWith()` matcher to verify that the response has the expected behavior.

Overall, this test ensures that the `handleSecret` function is correctly implemented and responds as expected when called with the appropriate request and response objects. */
