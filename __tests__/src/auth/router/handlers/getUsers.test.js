/* This code is a unit test for the `handleGetUsers` function, which is a route handler for the "getUsers" route in an authentication module. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the `handleGetUsers` function fetches users correctly and responds with the expected behavior.

Let's go through the code:

1. **Setting up environment and dependencies**: The code starts by setting up the environment with the `use strict` directive and setting the `SECRET` environment variable. It then requires the necessary modules, including the `db` object from the authentication models and the `handleGetUsers` function from the appropriate path.

2. **Database setup and cleanup**: The `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks are used to ensure that the database is synchronized before running the tests and dropped after all tests are done.

3. **Route Handler Test**: The test is wrapped inside a describe block titled "Router handler for getUsers."

   - **Test**: The test, titled "Should fetch users and send user objects in the response," sets up the necessary request, response, and next function objects. It calls the `handleGetUsers` function with these objects using the `await` keyword, as the function appears to involve asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching users from the database). The expectation is that the response will have a status code of 200 (OK) and that the `res.json` function will be called with any argument.

The test uses Jest's assertions and the `.toHaveBeenCalledWith()` matcher to verify that the response has the expected behavior.

Overall, this test ensures that the `handleGetUsers` function is correctly implemented and fetches users from the database as expected. It also checks that the response contains the appropriate status code and data when the function is called with the appropriate request and response objects.*/
